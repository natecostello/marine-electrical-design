AMPS was founded by recovering U.S. Naval Nuclear Propulsion engineers with decades of experience designing power, instrumentation, and control systems with utmost emphasis on capability, resilience, and redundancy. We take that experience and mindset and filter it through the safety and practicality of ABYC compliance to produce marine power systems composed of the best off-the-shelf components arranged and integrated in the optimal way.
